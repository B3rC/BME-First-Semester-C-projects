# BME First Semester C Projects

This repository contains the C projects I developed during my first semester at BME while learning the fundamentals of programming in C. These projects demonstrate my understanding of basic programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. They serve as a foundation for my journey into software development.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**
- **Description:** A single-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against the computer with varying difficulty levels.
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic board size (adjustable dimensions).
  - Computer opponent with difficulty levels powered by the minimax algorithm.
  - Graphical user interface built using SDL2.


### 2. **Smaller Projects**
In addition to Tic-Tac-Toe, this repository also includes a collection of smaller C projects. These are simpler programs aimed at reinforcing core programming concepts:

All smaller projects are grouped together in a dedicated folder for better organization.

## Tools and Environment
- **Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Development Environment:** Code::Blocks on Windows 11

## Learning Highlights
- Strengthened my understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
- Learned to design modular programs using functions and header files.
- Implemented advanced algorithms like minimax and used graphical programming libraries.
- Developed problem-solving skills by implementing algorithms for real-world scenarios.
